Feature: epidemic

  Whenever a player draws an Epidemic card, discard the card into the Player Discard Pile and do the following:

  Increase the Infection Rate: Move the Infection Rate Indicator up by one on the Infection Rate Track on the board

  Infect: Take the bottom card from the Infection Draw Pile and add 3 cubes to the city pictured on the card, then place the card into the Infection Discard Pile. Note: No city can contain more than 3 cubes of any one color. If the Epidemic would cause the city to exceed that limit, any excess cubes are returned to the stock and an outbreak is triggered. If there are not enough cubes to add to the board during an Epidemic, the game immediately ends in defeat for all players.

  Increase the intensity of infection: Take the Infection Discard Pile, thoroughly shuffle it, then place it on top of the remaining Infection Draw Pile. (Donâ€™t shuffle these cards into the Infection Draw Pile.)
