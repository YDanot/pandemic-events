Feature: sharing knowledge

  Transfer a card from one player to another.
  Every card transferred costs 1 action.
  Both your pawn and your fellow playerâ€™s pawn must be in the same city, and you may only transfer the card of the city that you are in together.
  (For example, if you are together in Moscow, only the Moscow card may be transferred from one player to the other.)
